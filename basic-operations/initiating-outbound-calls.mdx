2. ✅ **Outbound agent/workflow** - An agent or workflow is configured for outbound calls
3. ✅ **Outbound enabled** - Outbound calling is enabled in workspace settings
4. ✅ **Sufficient credits** - Your workspace has enough credits for outbound calls
5. ✅ **Twilio integration** - Twilio is connected and properly configured

## Enabling Outbound Calls

### Step 1: Check Workspace Settings

1. Navigate to **Workspace > Settings**

## Making Outbound Calls

2. Enter the phone number you want to call
3. Click **"Call"**
4. The call will be initiated using your configured outbound agent/workflow

### Method 2: Campaigns

For larger-scale outbound calling, use campaigns:

1. Navigate to **Campaign** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Create Campaign"**
3. Configure campaign settings:
   - **Name** - Campaign name
   - **Phone Numbers** - List of numbers to call
   - **Agent/Workflow** - Which agent/workflow to use
   - **Schedule** - When to start calling
4. Launch the campaign

### Method 3: API

You can also initiate calls programmatically using Freya's API:

```bash
POST /api/v2/call
{
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "customerPhoneNumber": "+0987654321",
  "agentId": "agent_123",
  "workspaceId": "workspace_456"
}
```

## Outbound Call Configuration

### Phone Number Settings

When configuring outbound routing:

<ParamField body="outboundAgentId" type="string">
  The agent ID to use for outbound calls (if using Agents configuration)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="outboundWorkflowId" type="string">
  The workflow ID to use for outbound calls (if using Workflows configuration)
</ParamField>

### Agent/Workflow Considerations

For outbound calls, consider:

- **Opening Message** - How the agent introduces itself
- **Call Purpose** - Why you're calling (sales, support, etc.)
- **Compliance** - Ensure compliance with calling regulations
- **Opt-out Handling** - How to handle opt-out requests

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Always test outbound calls with a small batch before launching large campaigns.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Ensure your agent's opening message clearly identifies who is calling and why.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Monitor call success rates and adjust your approach based on real data.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Ensure compliance with local calling regulations (TCPA, GDPR, etc.) before making outbound calls.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  Respect opt-out requests immediately and maintain a do-not-call list.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Calls Not Initiating

If outbound calls aren't starting:

1. **Check Workspace Settings**
   - Verify outbound is enabled
   - Check credit balance
   - Ensure workspace is active

2. **Verify Phone Number**
   - Confirm outbound routing is configured
   - Check phone number status
   - Verify Twilio integration

3. **Check Agent/Workflow**
   - Ensure outbound agent/workflow exists
   - Verify it's properly configured
   - Test it separately

### Low Success Rates

If calls aren't connecting:

1. **Phone Number Validation**
   - Verify numbers are in correct format
   - Check for invalid numbers
   - Remove duplicates

2. **Call Timing**
   - Avoid calling outside business hours
   - Consider time zones
   - Respect calling restrictions

3. **Agent Performance**
   - Review call recordings
   - Analyze conversation quality
   - Improve agent prompts

## Compliance and Regulations

When making outbound calls:

- **TCPA Compliance** (US) - Obtain consent before calling
- **GDPR Compliance** (EU) - Respect privacy regulations
- **Do Not Call Lists** - Maintain and respect DNC lists
