## Inbound Call Processing

Inbound calls are calls that customers or users initiate to your phone numbers. These are typically support calls, sales inquiries, appointment requests, or other customer-initiated interactions.

## Inbound Call Flow

### Call Reception

**Number Identification**: When a call arrives, Freyavoice AI identifies which phone number received it.

**Number Resolution**: The system looks up the configuration for that number to determine routing.

**Session Creation**: A new call session is created with a unique call ID for tracking.

**Context Loading**: Any relevant context (customer data, previous interactions) is loaded.

### Routing

**Agent Routing**: If configured with an agent, the call is routed directly to that agent.

**Workflow Routing**: If configured with a workflow, the workflow engine processes the call.

**Conditional Routing**: Workflows can route based on conditions like time of day, caller ID, or other factors.

**Fallback Routing**: If primary routing fails, fallback paths are used.

### Processing

**Agent Activation**: The agent loads its configuration, system prompt, and functions.

**Conversation Start**: The agent greets the caller and begins the conversation.

**Real-Time Processing**: The agent processes each turn of conversation in real-time.

**Function Execution**: Functions are called as needed to fetch data or perform actions.

**Context Management**: Conversation context is maintained throughout the call.

### Completion

**Call End**: The call ends when either party hangs up or the conversation completes.

**Data Storage**: Call data, transcript, and metadata are stored.

**Webhooks**: Webhook events are sent for call completion.

**Analytics**: Call data is processed for analytics and reporting.

## Optimizing Inbound Calls

### Response Time

**Fast Connection**: Minimize time between call arrival and agent response.

**Quick Greeting**: Agents should greet callers quickly to avoid silence.

**Efficient Processing**: Optimize agent prompts and functions for speed.

**Reduced Latency**: Monitor and optimize latency throughout the call flow.

### Call Quality

**Audio Optimization**: Ensure high-quality audio for clear communication.

**Network Quality**: Monitor network conditions and optimize for quality.

**Codec Selection**: Use appropriate codecs for best quality and efficiency.

**Echo Handling**: Proper echo cancellation for better call experience.

### User Experience

**Clear Communication**: Ensure agents speak clearly and are easy to understand.

**Helpful Responses**: Agents should provide helpful, accurate responses.

**Efficient Resolution**: Resolve caller needs quickly and effectively.

**Professional Service**: Maintain professional tone and service quality.

## Inbound Call Scenarios

**Document Processes**: Document your inbound call handling processes.

### Optimization

**Analyze Performance**: Regularly analyze call performance and identify improvements.

**Iterate on Prompts**: Continuously improve agent prompts based on real conversations.

**Optimize Routing**: Refine routing logic based on call patterns and outcomes.

**Improve Functions**: Optimize functions for speed and reliability.

### Monitoring

**Track Metrics**: Monitor key metrics like call volume, duration, and success rates.

**Review Transcripts**: Regularly review call transcripts to identify issues.

**User Feedback**: Collect and act on user feedback about call experiences.

**Error Tracking**: Monitor and address errors promptly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Calls Not Connecting**: Check number configuration, provider connection, and routing setup.

**Poor Audio Quality**: Verify network connectivity, codec settings, and provider quality.

**Agent Not Responding**: Check agent configuration, system prompt, and model settings.

**Slow Response Times**: Optimize prompts, reduce function call times, and check system load.

### Debugging

**Call Logs**: Review call logs to identify issues and patterns.

**Provider Logs**: Check provider-side logs for telephony issues.

**Agent Logs**: Review agent execution logs for processing issues.

**Network Diagnostics**: Check network connectivity and quality.
