## Voice Configuration Overview

Voice configuration determines how your agents sound to callers. Proper voice configuration is essential for creating professional, engaging, and effective voice AI experiences.

## Voice Components

### Voice Provider

**Provider Selection**: Choose a voice provider (ElevenLabs, etc.) that matches your quality and cost requirements.

**Provider Features**: Different providers offer different features, voices, and capabilities.

**Cost Considerations**: Balance voice quality with cost based on your needs.

**Reliability**: Choose providers with high reliability and uptime.

### Voice Selection

**Voice Characteristics**: Select voices based on:
- Gender
- Age
- Accent
- Tone (professional, friendly, casual, etc.)

**Brand Alignment**: Choose voices that align with your brand identity.

**Use Case Matching**: Match voice characteristics to your use case (sales, support, etc.).

**Testing**: Always test voices on actual phone calls, not just in the dashboard.

### Voice Settings

**Speaking Speed**: Control how fast the agent speaks:
- Slower speeds (0.8-0.9x) for complex information
- Normal speeds (1.0x) for standard conversations
- Faster speeds (1.1-1.2x) for simple confirmations

**Voice Stability**: Control voice consistency:
- Higher stability (0.7-0.9) for consistent, professional delivery
- Lower stability (0.3-0.5) for more natural, varied delivery

**Voice Similarity**: Control how closely the voice matches the original (if using cloned voices).

## Audio Quality

### Codec Selection

**G.711**: Standard telephony codec, widely supported, good quality.

**G.722**: Wideband codec for better audio quality.

**Opus**: Modern codec with excellent quality and efficiency.

**Automatic Selection**: Codecs are typically selected automatically based on network conditions.

### Quality Optimization

**Network Conditions**: Audio quality adapts to network conditions automatically.

**Bitrate Management**: Bitrate is optimized for quality and bandwidth.

**Echo Cancellation**: Built-in echo cancellation improves call quality.

**Noise Reduction**: Noise reduction algorithms enhance audio clarity.

## Voice Best Practices

### Selection

**Match Brand**: Choose voices that match your brand personality.

**Test Thoroughly**: Test voices on actual phone calls, not just simulations.

**Consider Audience**: Select voices that resonate with your target audience.

**Professional Quality**: Ensure voices sound professional and clear.

### Configuration

**Optimize Speed**: Adjust speaking speed based on content complexity.

**Balance Stability**: Find the right balance between consistency and naturalness.

**Test Settings**: Test different voice settings to find optimal configuration.

**Monitor Quality**: Continuously monitor voice quality in production.

### Content

**Clear Scripts**: Write clear, natural scripts for agents.

**Appropriate Tone**: Match agent tone to conversation context.

**Pronunciation**: Ensure proper pronunciation of technical terms or names.

**Pacing**: Structure content for natural pacing and pauses.

## Advanced Voice Features

### Voice Cloning

**Custom Voices**: Create custom voices using voice cloning technology.

**Brand Voices**: Use brand-specific voices for consistent experience.

**Personality Voices**: Create voices with specific personalities.

**Quality Requirements**: Ensure high-quality source audio for cloning.

### Multi-Language Support

**Language Selection**: Configure different voices for different languages.

**Accent Selection**: Choose appropriate accents for each language.

**Language Switching**: Support language switching during conversations.

**Cultural Considerations**: Consider cultural preferences for voice characteristics.

### Dynamic Voice

**Context-Aware**: Adjust voice characteristics based on conversation context.

**Emotion Expression**: Express emotions appropriately through voice.

**Emphasis**: Use voice emphasis to highlight important information.

**Natural Variation**: Add natural variation to avoid robotic sound.

## Quality Monitoring

### Metrics

**Audio Quality**: Monitor audio quality metrics (MOS scores, etc.).

**User Feedback**: Collect feedback about voice quality from users.

**Technical Metrics**: Track technical metrics like latency and packet loss.

**Subjective Quality**: Assess subjective quality through testing and feedback.

### Optimization

**Continuous Improvement**: Continuously improve voice configuration based on feedback.

**A/B Testing**: Test different voice configurations to find what works best.

**Quality Analysis**: Analyze call recordings to assess voice quality.

**Iterative Refinement**: Refine voice settings iteratively based on data.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Poor Audio Quality**: Check network conditions, codec settings, and provider quality.

**Robotic Sound**: Adjust voice stability and add natural variation.

**Unclear Speech**: Optimize speaking speed and ensure clear pronunciation.

**Echo or Feedback**: Check echo cancellation settings and network quality.

### Debugging

**Call Recordings**: Review call recordings to identify quality issues.

**Network Diagnostics**: Check network connectivity and quality.

**Provider Support**: Contact voice provider support for technical issues.

**Configuration Review**: Verify all voice configuration settings are correct.
