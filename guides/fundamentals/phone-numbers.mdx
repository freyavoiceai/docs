## Phone Number Overview

Phone numbers are your connection point to the telephony network. They enable your agents and workflows to receive and make calls, connecting your AI applications to the real world.

## Phone Number Types

### Imported Numbers

**From Twilio**: Import existing phone numbers from your Twilio account. This is the most common way to add phone numbers to Freya.

**From Other Providers**: Import numbers from other telephony providers that Freya supports.

**Number Validation**: Freya validates imported numbers to ensure they're active and accessible.

### Purchased Numbers

**Marketplace**: Purchase new phone numbers directly through Freya (if available in your region).

**Number Selection**: Choose numbers based on area code, vanity numbers, or other criteria.

**Instant Activation**: Purchased numbers are immediately available for use.

## Phone Number Configuration

### Basic Information

**Phone Number**: The actual phone number (e.g., +1234567890). This is usually set automatically when importing.

**Friendly Name**: A descriptive name for the number (e.g., "Main Support Line", "Sales Hotline"). This helps identify numbers in your dashboard.

**Capabilities**: Configure what the number can do:
- **Voice**: Enable voice calling (inbound, outbound, or bidirectional)
- **SMS**: Enable SMS messaging
- **MMS**: Enable MMS messaging (if supported)
- **Fax**: Enable fax capabilities (if supported)

### Routing Configuration

**Configuration Type**: Choose how to route calls:
- **Agents**: Route directly to specific agents
- **Workflows**: Route through workflows for complex logic

**Inbound Routing**: Configure how inbound calls are handled:
- **Inbound Agent**: Which agent handles incoming calls
- **Inbound Workflow**: Which workflow processes incoming calls

**Outbound Routing**: Configure how outbound calls are initiated:
- **Outbound Agent**: Which agent is used for outbound calls
- **Outbound Workflow**: Which workflow handles outbound calls

### Advanced Settings

**Voice Configuration**: Configure voice-specific settings like codecs, quality, and routing.

**Messaging Configuration**: Set up webhooks and endpoints for SMS/MMS handling.

**Emergency Calls**: Configure emergency call handling if required by regulations.

## Phone Number Management

### Organization

**Grouping**: Organize phone numbers by purpose, department, or campaign.

**Naming Convention**: Use consistent naming conventions to easily identify numbers.

**Tagging**: Add tags to numbers for easier filtering and organization.

### Monitoring

**Usage Tracking**: Monitor call volume, duration, and patterns per number.

**Cost Tracking**: Track costs associated with each number.

**Quality Metrics**: Monitor call quality, drop rates, and connection success.

### Maintenance

**Regular Review**: Periodically review numbers to identify unused or underutilized ones.

**Configuration Updates**: Update routing configurations as your needs change.

**Provider Management**: Manage relationships with telephony providers.

## Best Practices

### Number Strategy

**Purpose-Driven**: Assign numbers based on clear purposes. Don't create numbers without a specific use case.

**Scalability**: Plan your number strategy to scale as your business grows.

**Cost Optimization**: Monitor costs and optimize number usage to control expenses.

**Compliance**: Ensure numbers comply with local regulations and requirements.

### Routing Design

**Start Simple**: Begin with simple agent routing, then upgrade to workflows as needs become more complex.

**Test Routing**: Always test routing configurations before going live.

**Monitor Performance**: Track which routing configurations perform best.

**Iterate**: Continuously improve routing based on call data and feedback.

### Number Lifecycle

**Acquisition**: Acquire numbers strategically based on your needs and budget.

**Configuration**: Configure numbers properly from the start to avoid issues.

**Monitoring**: Continuously monitor number performance and usage.

**Optimization**: Optimize number usage based on data and feedback.

**Retirement**: Properly retire or transfer numbers when no longer needed.

## Integration with Agents and Workflows

### Agent Integration

**Direct Connection**: Connect numbers directly to agents for simple use cases.

**Multiple Agents**: Use different numbers for different agents or purposes.

**Agent Switching**: Switch agents on a number as your needs evolve.

### Workflow Integration

**Complex Routing**: Use workflows when you need complex routing logic.

**Multi-Agent Workflows**: Workflows can route to different agents based on conditions.

**Dynamic Routing**: Workflows enable dynamic routing based on real-time conditions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Calls Not Connecting**: Check number status, provider connection, and routing configuration.

**Poor Audio Quality**: Verify network connectivity, codec settings, and provider quality.

**Routing Problems**: Review routing configuration and test with simulations.

**Cost Issues**: Monitor usage and optimize number allocation.

### Debugging

**Call Logs**: Review call logs to identify issues.

**Provider Logs**: Check provider-side logs for telephony issues.

**Configuration Review**: Verify all configuration settings are correct.

**Test Calls**: Make test calls to verify everything works.
