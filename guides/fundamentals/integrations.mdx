## Integration Overview

Integrations allow Freyavoice AI to connect with external systems, enabling your agents and workflows to interact with your existing infrastructure, fetch data, trigger actions, and synchronize information.

## Types of Integrations

### Telephony Providers

**Twilio**: Primary telephony provider for phone numbers and call handling. Import numbers, manage calls, and handle SMS/MMS.

**Other SIP Providers**: Connect to other Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) providers for call routing and management.

**Provider Configuration**: Configure authentication, endpoints, and settings for each provider.

### CRM Systems

**HubSpot**: Integrate with HubSpot to sync contact data, create records, and update customer information during calls.

**Salesforce**: Connect to Salesforce to access and update customer records, create leads, and log interactions.

**Custom CRM**: Build custom integrations with your CRM system using webhooks and API calls.

### Communication Platforms

**Slack**: Send notifications to Slack channels when calls complete, errors occur, or important events happen.

**Email**: Send email notifications, summaries, or transcripts after calls.

**SMS/MMS**: Handle text messaging through integrated providers.

### Database Systems

**Custom Databases**: Connect to your databases to fetch customer data, update records, or query information during calls.

**Data Warehouses**: Integrate with data warehouses for analytics and reporting.

**Real-time Data**: Access real-time data during conversations to provide up-to-date information.

### API Integrations

**REST APIs**: Connect to any REST API to fetch data or trigger actions.

**GraphQL APIs**: Integrate with GraphQL endpoints for flexible data queries.

**Webhooks**: Receive webhooks from external systems to trigger workflows or update state.

**Authentication**: Handle various authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, JWT, etc.).

## Integration Methods

### Function Calls

Functions are the primary way agents interact with external systems:

**Function Definition**: Define functions that agents can call during conversations.

**API Endpoints**: Functions can call external API endpoints to fetch or update data.

**Data Transformation**: Transform data between formats as needed.

**Error Handling**: Handle API errors gracefully and provide fallback behavior.

### Webhooks

Webhooks allow external systems to notify Freyavoice AI:

**Incoming Webhooks**: Receive webhooks from external systems to trigger workflows or update state.

**Outgoing Webhooks**: Send webhooks to external systems when events occur (call completed, error, etc.).

**Webhook Security**: Validate webhook signatures to ensure authenticity.

**Webhook Retries**: Handle webhook delivery failures with retry logic.

### Direct API Calls

Make direct API calls from workflows:

**HTTP Requests**: Make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to external APIs.

**Authentication**: Handle authentication for protected APIs.

**Response Processing**: Process API responses and use data in workflows.

**Error Handling**: Handle API failures and timeouts gracefully.

## Common Integration Patterns

### Customer Data Lookup

**Pattern**: Look up customer information at the start of a call to personalize the conversation.

**Implementation**: Function calls to CRM or database to fetch customer data.

**Usage**: Use customer data to personalize greetings, access order history, or provide account information.

### Order Processing

**Pattern**: Process orders or transactions during calls.

**Implementation**: API calls to order management systems to create, update, or query orders.

**Usage**: Agents can take orders, check order status, or process returns during calls.

### Appointment Scheduling

**Pattern**: Schedule appointments or meetings during calls.

**Implementation**: Integration with calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) to check availability and book appointments.

**Usage**: Agents can check availability, suggest times, and confirm appointments.

### Notification Systems

**Pattern**: Send notifications when important events occur.

**Implementation**: Webhooks or API calls to notification services (Slack, email, SMS).

**Usage**: Notify teams when calls complete, errors occur, or important milestones are reached.

### Data Synchronization

**Pattern**: Keep data synchronized between systems.

**Implementation**: Bidirectional sync between Freyavoice AI and external systems.

**Usage**: Sync contact information, call history, or other data between systems.

## Integration Best Practices

### Security

**Secure Credentials**: Never expose API keys or credentials in code. Use secure storage and environment variables.

**Authentication**: Use proper authentication methods (OAuth, API keys, JWT) for all integrations.

**Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

**Access Control**: Limit integration access to only what's necessary.

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**: Design integrations to fail gracefully. If an external system is unavailable, the agent should still function.

**Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for transient failures.

**Error Logging**: Log integration errors with sufficient context for debugging.

**User Communication**: Communicate integration failures to users in helpful, non-technical ways.

### Performance

**Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls and improve performance.

**Async Processing**: Process non-critical integrations asynchronously to avoid blocking conversations.

**Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement backoff strategies.

**Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections when possible to improve performance.

### Testing

**Test Integrations**: Thoroughly test all integrations before deploying to production.

**Mock Services**: Use mock services during development to avoid hitting production APIs.

**Integration Tests**: Create automated tests for critical integrations.

**Monitor Production**: Continuously monitor integrations in production for issues.

## Setting Up Integrations

### Telephony Integration (Twilio)

1. **Get Credentials**: Obtain Account SID and Auth Token from Twilio
2. **Connect in Freya**: Add credentials in the Integrations section
3. **Verify Connection**: Test the connection to ensure it works
4. **Import Numbers**: Import phone numbers from your Twilio account

### CRM Integration (HubSpot)

1. **Create API Key**: Generate an API key in HubSpot
2. **Configure in Freya**: Add API key in workspace integrations
3. **Define Functions**: Create functions that interact with HubSpot
4. **Test Integration**: Test functions to ensure they work correctly

### Custom API Integration

1. **Review API Documentation**: Understand the API endpoints and authentication
2. **Create Functions**: Define functions that call the API
3. **Handle Authentication**: Implement proper authentication
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all API interactions

## Monitoring Integrations

### Health Checks

**Connection Status**: Monitor connection status for all integrations.

**Response Times**: Track API response times to identify performance issues.

**Error Rates**: Monitor error rates to catch integration problems early.

**Usage Metrics**: Track integration usage to understand patterns and optimize.

### Alerts

**Failure Alerts**: Set up alerts for integration failures.

**Performance Alerts**: Alert when response times exceed thresholds.

**Error Alerts**: Get notified of integration errors immediately.
