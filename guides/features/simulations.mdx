## What Are Simulations?

Simulations allow you to test your agents and workflows in a controlled environment before connecting them to real phone numbers. This enables you to validate behavior, catch issues early, and iterate quickly without the cost and complexity of real phone calls.

## Why Use Simulations?

### Cost Savings

**No Phone Costs**: Test without incurring telephony charges. Simulations don't use phone minutes or incur provider fees.

**Iterate Freely**: Make unlimited test calls without worrying about costs. This encourages experimentation and thorough testing.

**Budget Management**: Test extensively before deploying to production, ensuring you only pay for real customer calls.

### Faster Development

**Instant Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on agent behavior without waiting for real calls.

**Rapid Iteration**: Quickly test changes and improvements without the overhead of real phone calls.

**Parallel Testing**: Test multiple scenarios simultaneously without coordination.

### Risk Reduction

**Catch Issues Early**: Identify problems before they affect real customers.

**Validate Behavior**: Ensure agents and workflows behave as expected.

**Test Edge Cases**: Test unusual scenarios that might be difficult to trigger with real calls.

## Creating Simulations

### Basic Simulation

**Select Agent/Workflow**: Choose which agent or workflow to test.

**Configure Settings**: Set up simulation parameters like language, voice, and initial context.

**Start Simulation**: Begin the simulation and interact with your agent.

**Review Results**: Analyze the conversation, agent responses, and any function calls.

### Advanced Simulation

**Custom Scenarios**: Create custom test scenarios with specific inputs and expected outputs.

**Multi-Turn Conversations**: Test extended conversations to validate context management.

**Error Testing**: Test error conditions and edge cases.

**Performance Testing**: Measure response times and identify performance issues.

## Simulation Features

### Conversation Interface

**Text Input**: Type messages as if you were speaking on a phone call.

**Audio Playback**: Listen to how the agent sounds (if audio is enabled).

**Transcript View**: See the full conversation transcript in real-time.

**Function Calls**: View function calls made during the simulation.

### Analysis Tools

**Response Quality**: Analyze agent responses for clarity, accuracy, and appropriateness.

**Function Execution**: Review function calls to ensure they're working correctly.

**Context Management**: Verify that context is maintained correctly throughout the conversation.

**Performance Metrics**: Track response times and identify bottlenecks.

### Testing Scenarios

**Happy Path**: Test the ideal conversation flow where everything works as expected.

**Edge Cases**: Test unusual inputs, error conditions, and boundary cases.

**Error Handling**: Verify that errors are handled gracefully.

**Multi-Language**: Test conversations in different languages if your agent supports them.

## Best Practices

### Test Before Deploying

**Always Simulate**: Never deploy agents or workflows without testing in simulation first.

**Test All Paths**: Ensure all conversation paths and workflow branches are tested.

**Test Edge Cases**: Don't just test the happy path - test unusual scenarios too.

### Comprehensive Testing

**Multiple Scenarios**: Test various conversation scenarios to ensure robust behavior.

**Different Users**: Simulate different types of users (friendly, frustrated, confused, etc.).

**Various Topics**: Test conversations about different topics your agent should handle.

**Error Conditions**: Test what happens when things go wrong.

### Iterative Testing

**Test After Changes**: Always test after making changes to agents or workflows.

**Compare Versions**: Compare behavior between different versions to ensure improvements.

**Continuous Testing**: Make testing a regular part of your development process.

## Simulation Workflow

### Planning

**Define Test Cases**: Plan what scenarios you want to test.

**Set Expectations**: Define what successful behavior looks like for each scenario.

**Prepare Test Data**: Gather any test data needed for your scenarios.

### Execution

**Run Simulations**: Execute your test scenarios.

**Observe Behavior**: Watch how the agent or workflow behaves.

**Take Notes**: Document any issues or unexpected behavior.

### Analysis

**Review Transcripts**: Analyze conversation transcripts for quality and accuracy.

**Check Function Calls**: Verify that functions are called correctly and return expected results.

**Measure Performance**: Track response times and identify performance issues.

**Identify Issues**: Document any problems or areas for improvement.

### Iteration

**Fix Issues**: Address any problems identified during testing.

**Retest**: Run simulations again to verify fixes.

**Refine**: Continue iterating until behavior meets your standards.

## Advanced Simulation Techniques

### Automated Testing

**Test Scripts**: Create scripts to automate simulation testing.

**Regression Testing**: Run the same tests after changes to catch regressions.

**Continuous Integration**: Integrate simulation testing into your CI/CD pipeline.

### Performance Testing

**Load Testing**: Test how agents perform under various load conditions.

**Response Time**: Measure and optimize response times.

**Resource Usage**: Monitor resource consumption during simulations.

### User Experience Testing

**Conversation Flow**: Test that conversations flow naturally.

**User Satisfaction**: Evaluate whether conversations meet user needs.

**Clarity**: Ensure agent responses are clear and helpful.
