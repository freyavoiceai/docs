## Analytics Overview

Freyavoice AI provides comprehensive analytics to help you understand call performance, agent effectiveness, user satisfaction, and business metrics. These insights enable data-driven decisions and continuous improvement.

## Key Metrics

### Call Metrics

**Call Volume**: Total number of calls, calls per day/hour, and trends over time. This helps you understand usage patterns and plan capacity.

**Call Success Rate**: Percentage of calls that complete successfully versus those that fail or drop. High success rates indicate good system health.

**Call Quality**: Audio quality metrics, connection stability, and technical performance indicators.

### Agent Performance

**Response Quality**: Analysis of agent responses for clarity, accuracy, and helpfulness. This helps identify areas for prompt improvement.

**Goal Achievement**: Percentage of calls where agents successfully achieve their goals (sales, support resolution, etc.).

**Function Usage**: Which functions are called most often and how effectively they're used.

**Context Management**: How well agents maintain context throughout conversations.

### User Satisfaction

**Sentiment Analysis**: Analysis of caller sentiment throughout conversations. Positive sentiment indicates good experiences.

**Resolution Rate**: Percentage of calls where user issues are resolved or goals are achieved.

**User Feedback**: Direct feedback from users about their experience (if collected).
