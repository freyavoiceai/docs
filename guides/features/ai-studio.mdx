## What is AI Studio?

AI Studio is an intelligent tool that helps you refine and improve your agent's system prompt using AI assistance. Instead of manually editing long prompts, you can describe what you want to change, and AI Studio will help you improve your prompts iteratively.

## Key Features

### Interactive Prompt Editing

AI Studio provides a split-screen interface where you can:

**Chat with AI**: Describe what you want to change or improve in natural language. The AI understands your intent and suggests improvements.

**See Changes Live**: Watch as your prompt is improved in real-time. Changes appear in the editor as the AI processes your requests.

**Iterate Quickly**: Make multiple improvements in a single session, refining your prompt until it's perfect.

### AI-Powered Suggestions

The AI assistant can help with:

**Clarity Improvements**: Make prompts clearer and more understandable.

**Tone Adjustments**: Modify the agent's personality and speaking style.

**Feature Additions**: Add new capabilities or instructions to your agent.

**Structure Optimization**: Reorganize prompts for better readability and effectiveness.

**Context Enhancement**: Add relevant context or examples to improve agent performance.

## Using AI Studio

### Opening AI Studio

1. Navigate to an agent's configuration page
2. Find the **System Prompt** section
3. Click the **"AI Studio"** button (usually represented by a sparkles or magic wand icon)

### Making Improvements

**Describe Your Goal**: In the chat interface, describe what you want to improve. For example:
- "Make the prompt more professional"
- "Add instructions for handling angry customers"
- "Improve clarity and remove ambiguity"
- "Add context about our return policy"

**Review Suggestions**: The AI will analyze your current prompt and suggest improvements. Review the changes in the editor.

**Iterate**: Ask for more changes, accept suggestions, or make manual edits. Continue until you're satisfied.

**Save Changes**: Once happy with the improved prompt, save it to your agent.

### Best Practices

**Be Specific**: The more specific your requests, the better the improvements. Instead of "make it better," say "make it more concise and add examples."

**Iterate in Steps**: Make one type of improvement at a time. This gives you better control and makes it easier to understand changes.

**Review Carefully**: Always review AI-generated changes before saving. The AI is helpful but may not always understand your exact requirements.

**Test After Changes**: Test your agent after making prompt changes to ensure improvements work as expected.

## Advanced Features

### Thinking Process

AI Studio shows you the AI's thinking process:

**Evaluation Phase**: How the AI analyzes your current prompt

**Planning Phase**: What changes the AI plans to make

**Execution Phase**: The actual improvements being applied

This transparency helps you understand how your prompt is being improved and learn better prompt engineering techniques.

### Variable Support

AI Studio understands Freya's variable syntax:

**Dynamic Values**: Use `{{variable}}` for dynamic values in prompts

**Preservation**: Variables are preserved in improved prompts

**Highlighting**: Variables are highlighted in the editor for easy identification

### Copy and Export

**Copy Prompt**: Copy the improved prompt to use elsewhere or share with your team

**Export Options**: Export prompts in various formats if needed

## Use Cases

### Making Prompts More Professional

Transform casual or informal prompts into professional, business-appropriate language suitable for customer-facing applications.

**Example Request**: "Make this prompt sound more professional and business-appropriate"

**Result**: The AI removes casual phrases, adds formal language, and ensures the tone matches business standards.

### Adding Specific Instructions

Add detailed instructions for handling specific scenarios or edge cases.

**Example Request**: "Add instructions for handling customers who want to cancel their subscription"

**Result**: The AI adds a new section with specific cancellation handling instructions, including empathy, retention strategies, and process steps.

### Improving Clarity

Restructure confusing prompts to make them clearer and easier to understand.

**Example Request**: "This prompt is confusing. Make it clearer and easier to understand"

**Result**: The AI restructures the prompt, simplifies language, adds clear sections, and improves organization.

### Adding Context

Enhance prompts with relevant business context, product information, or domain knowledge.

**Example Request**: "Add context about our company's return policy and warranty information"

**Result**: The AI incorporates return policy details, warranty terms, and relevant information into the prompt in a natural way.
