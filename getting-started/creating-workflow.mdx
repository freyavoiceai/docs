## Overview

Workflows allow you to create complex call routing and processing logic by combining multiple agents, conditions, and integrations. Workflows are perfect for handling multi-step processes, conditional routing, and complex business logic.

## Creating a Workflow

### Step 1: Navigate to Workflows

1. Click on **"Workflows"** in the sidebar navigation
2. You'll see a list of all your workflows (or an empty state if you don't have any)

### Step 2: Create a New Workflow

Click the **"Create Workflow"** button. You can also:

- Click **"Create from Template"** to start from a pre-built template
- Click **"Create Blank Workflow"** to start from scratch

### Step 3: Configure Your Workflow

When you create a new workflow, you'll be taken to the workflow editor. Here you can:

#### Basic Information

- **Workflow Name** - A descriptive name for your workflow
- **Description** - Optional description of what the workflow does
- **Tags** - Add tags to organize your workflows

#### Workflow Structure

Workflows are built using nodes:

- **Initial Node** - The starting point of your workflow
- **Agent Nodes** - Connect to AI agents to handle conversations
- **Function Nodes** - Execute custom functions or API calls
- **Condition Nodes** - Route calls based on conditions
- **Transfer Nodes** - Transfer to human agents or other systems

#### Adding Nodes

1. Click **"Add Node"** in the workflow editor
2. Select the type of node you want to add
3. Configure the node's settings
4. Connect nodes by dragging from one node's output to another's input

#### Configuring Nodes

Each node type has different configuration options:

**Agent Node:**
- Select which agent to use
- Configure agent-specific settings
- Set response behavior

**Function Node:**
- Define the function to call
- Set input parameters
- Configure error handling

**Condition Node:**
- Define the condition to check
- Set routing logic for true/false outcomes

### Step 4: Save Your Workflow

1. Click **"Save"** to save your workflow
2. Your workflow is now ready to be connected to phone numbers

## Workflow Templates

Freya provides pre-built workflow templates to help you get started:

- **Simple Agent** - Single agent workflow
- **Agent with Transfer** - Agent that can transfer to humans
- **Multi-Agent Routing** - Route calls to different agents based on conditions
- **Function Integration** - Workflow with custom function calls

## Testing Workflows

Before connecting your workflow to a phone number:

1. Use the workflow simulation feature
2. Test different scenarios and conditions
3. Verify that routing logic works as expected
4. Check that all integrations function properly

## Workflow Best Practices

<Tip>
  Start simple with a single agent node, then gradually add complexity as needed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use descriptive names for nodes to make your workflow easy to understand.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Test all conditional branches to ensure proper routing.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Complex workflows can be difficult to debug. Start simple and add complexity incrementally.
</Warning>

## Copying Workflows

You can copy existing workflows to:

- Create variations of successful workflows
- Use as templates for new workflows
- Experiment without modifying the original

1. Click the **"Copy"** icon on any workflow card
2. The workflow will be duplicated with a new name
3. Edit the copy as needed
