## Overview

The Freya Model APIs provide direct access to our Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. These are standalone inference endpoints — separate from the platform Call API.

| Model | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Speech-to-Text | `stt.freyavoice.ai` | Transcribe audio files to text |
| Text-to-Speech | `tts.freyavoice.ai` | Convert text to natural-sounding speech |

## Authentication

All endpoints require a Bearer token issued by your workspace. See the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication) for how to generate an API key.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

## Quick start

### Speech-to-Text

```bash
curl -X POST "https://stt.freyavoice.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -F "file=@audio.wav" \
  -F "language=tr"
```

### Text-to-Speech

```bash
curl -X POST "https://tts.freyavoice.ai/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Merhaba, Freya ile konuşuyorsunuz.", "voice": "leyla", "model": "tts-1"}'
```

<Note>
  These Model APIs are independent of the Freyavoice Call API. They can be used standalone for any speech processing task, not just within Freya call workflows.
