description: 'Get your API key to start using the Freya APIs'

All Freya API endpoints require a **Bearer token** for authentication. This token is tied to your workspace and can be generated from the dashboard.

## 1. Create an account

Head to [app.freyavoice.ai](https://app.freyavoice.ai) and sign up for a free account.

<Card
  title="Sign up for Freya"
  icon="arrow-up-right-from-square"
  href="https://app.freyavoice.ai"
>
  Create your account and workspace at app.freyavoice.ai
</Card>

## 2. Create a workspace

After signing in, you'll be prompted to create your first workspace. Workspaces are isolated environments — each one has its own agents, phone numbers, and API keys.

<Note>
  If you already have a workspace, you can skip this step and go straight to generating an API key.
</Note>

## 3. Generate an API key

Once inside your workspace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the menu">
    Click the **menu icon** next to your avatar in the bottom-left corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Keys">
    Select **Keys** from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click **Create API Key**, give it a name, and copy the generated token. Store it somewhere safe — it won't be shown again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Use the token in requests

Pass the token as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://stt.freyavoice.ai/v1/audio/transcriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -F "file=@audio.wav"
```

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables or a secrets manager to keep it secure.
</Warning>
